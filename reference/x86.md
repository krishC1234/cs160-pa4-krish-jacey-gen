# x86-64 info
## registers

- 16 of them: `%rax`, `%rbx`, `%rcx`, `%rdx`, `%rsi`, `%rdi`, `%rsp`, `%rbp`, `%r{8--15}`

- the 'r' means it's an 8-byte register

    - other names can be used to access their lower bits as 32-, 16-, or 8-bit registers (which we'll need for the `set` instruction)

- special registers

    - `%rsp` is the stack pointer
    - `%rbp` is the frame pointer
    - `%rax` holds function return values
    - `%rax` and `%rdx` are used for division
    - `%rdi`, `%rsi`, `%rdx`, `%rcx`, `%r8`, `%r9` pass the first 6 arguments of a call

- caller/callee-save:

    - caller-save: `%rax`, `%rcx`, `%rdx`, `%rdi`, `%rsi`, `%rsp`, `%r{8--11}`
    - callee-save: `%rbx`, `%rbp`, `%r{12--15}`

- for x86-64 normally codegen doesn't use the frame pointer (instead calculating stack addresses as offsets from the frame pointer), which frees up `%rbp` to be used for other things; for simplicity though we'll use the frame pointer in the traditional way

## instruction operands

- operands are registers, constants, or memory locations

- notation

    - `imm` ("immediate") denotes a constant value
    - `R` denotes a register
    - `[R]` denotes the value inside a register
    - `<x>` denotes the value at memory address `x`

```
OPERAND | VALUE
--------+-----------------
   $imm | constant
    imm | <imm>
      R | [R]
 imm(R) | <imm + [R]>
```

- there are other operands, but we'll only use these

- note that not all combinations of operands are valid, and which operands are allowed (and which combinations) depend on the instruction

## instructions

- we're using AT&T syntax, which is the syntax used by the standard linux assembler GAS

    - the alternative is Intel syntax, which has the operands reversed from AT&T

    - both are widely used, if looking at docs be sure you know which syntax they're using

- most instructions use a one-character suffix to indicate the size of the operands; some have 0 (like ret) and some can have multiple (e.g., if they are converting from one size to another):

    - `b` = byte (1 byte)
    - `w` = word (2 bytes)
    - `l` = double word (4 bytes)
    - `q` = quadword (8 bytes)

- we'll be using `q` exclusively.

- notation

    - `S` = source operand (where value comes from)
    - `D` = destination operand (where value goes to)
    - `C` = condition code (`e`, `ne`, `z`, `nz`, `s`, `ns`, `g`, `ge`, `l`, `le`)
        - `s` means 'negative'

- instructions with a 1-character suffix (`q` for us)

```
mov S, D   : move S to D
lea S, D   : load effective address of S into D (like mov, except without final load)
push S     : push S onto stack (adjusts %rsp)
pop D      : pop from stack into D (adjusts %rsp)
inc D      : increment D by 1 in-place
dec D      : decrement D by 1 in-place
add S, D   : add S to D
sub S, D   : subtract S from D
imul S, D  : signed multiply D by S
idiv S     : signed divide %rdx:%rax by S; %rax = quotient
cmp S2, S1 : set condition code according to S1 - S2
```

- instructions with no suffix

```
set{C} D   : set lower byte of D to 1 if condition code is C
jmp lbl    : jump to lbl
j{C} lbl   : jump if condition code is C
call lbl   : push return address to stack and jump to label (adjusts %rsp)
ret        : pop return address from stack and jump there (adjusts %rsp)
cqo        : sign-extend %rax into %rdx (used for division)
```

## operand restrictions

- notation

    - `R` = register
    - `M` = memory
    - `I` = immediate

- âˆ€`D`, `D` cannot be `I`

- if there are two operands, they cannot both be `M`

- `lea`: `S` must be `M`, `D` must be `R`

- `imul`: `D` must be `R`

- `idiv`: `S` cannot be `I`

- `cmp`: `S1` cannot be `I`
